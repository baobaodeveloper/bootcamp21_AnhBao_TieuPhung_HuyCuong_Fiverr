              Yes you can purchase either basic or standard package
              and upgrade later. You can also purchase any of my gig
              extras later.

          >
            <p>
              The most important reason to have a source or vector
              file is so you have the ability to edit and manipulate
              your own logo. It provides a level of ownership to your
              own product that you wouldnâ€™t otherwise have.
